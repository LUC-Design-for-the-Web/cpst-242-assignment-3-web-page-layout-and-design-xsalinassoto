# Overview

For assignment 3, you will continue to develop your site by coding the distinct wire-frames you created in assignment 2.  You will also solidify your color and graphics strategy by selecting the colors and typography you will use in the final draft of your site. 


Listed below are the  requirements you will need to complete for your individual project. Your project folder will need to  implement a hierarchical folder structure along with coded html documents containing the layout(s) of your site.

## Requirement 1 (Layout Strategy): 

For this requirement, you will need to code the desktop wire-frame(s) for each distinct layout constructed in assignment 2 using the layout strategies we discussed in class (Traditional Float, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid).   The desktop version of the wire-frame(s) you created in assignment 2 should guide you in the development of your lay-out(s). If your site has multiple distinct layouts, please code the layouts in separate html documents.  For example, if your site has three distinct layouts, your filenames will be layout_one.html, layout_two.html, layout_three.html.   Please use borders, placeholder.com or background color to display the various box elements in the lay-out if there is no content or images to display within the box element.

## Requirement 2 (Color and Graphic Strategy): 

For this requirement, you will need to solidify your site’s color and graphic strategy.  Graphics may include logo, banner and background images. Once you have identified your sites color scheme, please provide the following information for each item listed below.  Within in the CSS code, please comment your response for questions 1 -3.  Your comments should be placed prior to any CSS style rules. 

- How did you decide on your site’s color scheme? 
- Provide me with the color palette you will use within your site and provide the hexadecimals values for each color.
- What areas of your site will be impacted by your color choice? Be descriptive in identifying where the various colors in your color palette will be depicted.  

**Please demonstrate your overall color scheme within the layout.html document.**

## Requirement 3 (Font Strategy): 
For this requirement, you will need to determine your site’s font strategy.  You are free to include as many fonts as you deem necessary, but its a good design practice to choose 1 or 2 fonts and use varying sizes and font weights. Feel free to incorporate fonts from Google, dafont.com or use the [global web safe fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) typically found across browsers and operating systems.  Once you have identified your sites font, please provide the following information for each item listed below.  Within the CSS code, please comment your response for questions 1 -3.  Your comments should be placed prior to any CSS style rules.  You will also need to place a brief comment above each style rule  describing where font will be rendered in the browser.

- What font(s) will you use for the ```<body>```(default declarations), ```<p>``` and ```<h1> - <h6>```(Your individual project must incorporate at least 3 levels of headings.)HTML tags? A CSS comment will also be be placed above each style rule that has the font or font-family property.
- What are the different weights and sizes of the heading and paragraph tags? 
- What is your desired line-height, word-spacing, and letter-spacing?

**Demonstrate your font scheme/strategy within the layout.html document.**
